# Django_Redux_ts__Login_Register_CRUD_no_update
here is a project with Django in the back and Redux in the front
in the back we have Login, Register and a full CRUD.
in the front we have Login, Register and a CRUD without 'PUT'.

## To enter the Back (Django), and install the VE and the requirements.txt file:
python -m virtualenv myenv             (once per project)
myenv\Scripts\activate                 (to activate, once per project)
pip install -r .\requirements.txt      (to install all the required packages)
py manage.py runserver

## To enter the Front (React) I write in the terminal:
      a. cd my-app
      b. npm install or npm i         (installs all dependencies in React including VE)
      c. npm start
